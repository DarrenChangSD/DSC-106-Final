    During the process of creating this project, 
    <br>
    <br>
    &emsp;&emsp; We first had ideas of using a map that shows all the Airbnbs as individual points on a scatterplot map, to make the visualization more intuitive. However, because our dataset was too large (~50k) to efficiently display all the points on the map without overcrowding it, we decided it would be better to show the distribution as a bar chart instead.
    <br>
    <br>
    &emsp;&emsp; When cleaning the data in order to use the New York City Neighborhood Map in Datawrapper we had to clean the "neighborhood" column in our dataset. This took a decent amount of time to implement due to how messy our dataset was. But after we got the data cleaned and was able to visualize on the map the results were a bit underwhleming. Since the dataset didn't have all the neighborhoods that were listed on Datawrapper we have a lot of missing data. There were also some neighborhood values that needed to be segregated to regions based on their latitude and longitude which was done using some simple logic. 
    <br>
    <br>
    &emsp;&emsp; When making the data visualization because we are dealing with geogrpahical data we made the choice to opt with many different map data visualizations. We thought these charts would be the best at communicating the conclusions we found through the data. We also found it was very difficult to make map data visualizations so we had to use an online tool in order to complete this goal. Through this process we saw first hand how important having the right data is in order to use a tool to its fullest. 
    <br>
    <br>
    &emsp;&emsp; A major limitation we experienced was the customization of the data visualizations we produced since we created them using a tool. If we were able to make these data visualization on our own I'm sure we could have added more features. Another limitation was the dataset. The dataset didn't have certain data points that we were looking for such as number of stars and dates of availability. If we had these data points it woul dhave greatly improved our analysis.

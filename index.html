        &emsp;&emsp; In this project, we are helping a friend plan a hypothetical NYC trip this winter!
        This is the first time that our friend is visiting New York, so she wants to explore different Airbnb options during her stay. She's on a slightly tight budget so the cost per night for the place she's staying at is also important too.

      </p>

      <p style="padding-left:120px;">
        &emsp;&emsp; First, to have a general idea on how many options are available in New York, we are going to see the distribution based on the 5 big neighborhood groups: Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. A higher distribution might mean that people are more willing to stay in that area compared to other places, further suggesting better transportation options and/or close proximity to tourist attractions.
      </p>

      <p style="padding-left:120px;">
        &emsp;&emsp; To see if our friend can actually afford these places, we charted a map chart analyzing the average price distribution for each specific neighborhood. This enables us to suggest Airbnbs with a good location, but not too expensive. By creating a chart that highlights each neighborhood we can pinpoint which specific neighborhood is the best location for its price.
      </p>

      <p style="padding-left:120px;">
        &emsp;&emsp; To have an idea of how much our friend should be able to spend on housing, we chose to explore the price range of Airbnbs located in Manhattan. This suggested the ideal budget for her to spend per night, which we decided as $80.
      </p>

      <p style="padding-left:120px;">
        &emsp;&emsp; Our friend want to stay in Manhattan and has a budget of $80 a night for housing. We will take these in considerationwhen trying to find the right fit. But we will also like to provide other neighborhoods as a possibility!

        &emsp;&emsp; The Data Science team and I understand the great pride on the food you serve and the sheer number of people McDonaldâ€™s is capable of serving.  We took this same pride and used the data we were able to collect to derive at some new insights.  Data driven approach to evaluate business operations is the future and the insights we discover will help benefit McDonald's future!

      <p style="padding-left:120px;">
        &emsp;&emsp; My team and I were given two CSV files as data to use for our exploration. The first CSV file we received was the daily_sales.csv which is daily sales data from the month of January 2016.  The second CSV file we used was monthly_sales.csv which is sales data for each month from January 2016 to September 2019.  It was not an idea situation to be only given the daily sales from January of 2016.  However, we worked through it!  The monthly data provided us with an ability to see the long term trend.

      <p style="padding-left:120px;">
        &emsp;&emsp; Another interesting aspect of the data besides the given time frames were the attributes.  We obtained sales data for Hamburgers, Chicken Fillets, and Fish Fillets.  Sales data were further divided by regions: NE, SW, NW, SE, and C.  In addition to the main primary question we were trying to solve, this provided us with an opportunity to explore if Burger King's Impossible Burger had any impact in the marketplace.
